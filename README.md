# Traning set generation for AO

This repository is a `Matlab` implementation of the generation for time-varying aberrations and corresponding feature intensity images.

##  Generating Time-varying Phase aberration
The time-varying phase aberration caused by atmospheric turbulence is generated by **Object-Oriented MATLAB & Adaptive Optics (OOMAO) Toolbox** [[1]].
The OOMAO sources are hosted by GitHub (https://github.com/rconan/OOMAO).
